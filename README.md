# PrototypeASMR

PrototypeASMR is a World of Warcraft addon that plays configurable sound effects when mounting specific mounts.  
It includes a full in-game GUI for managing mount → sound mappings, testing sounds, and toggling behavior.

The GUI is implemented in a separate file and does **not** modify the core addon logic.
